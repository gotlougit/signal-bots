# Signal Bots

This is a small repo of Signal bots I built by way of a series of scripts utilizing [signal-cli](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli). I am doing this mostly to make my own life more convenient.

## Requirements

bash, curl, jq, and signal-cli setup beforehand. **There are NO setup utilities for signal-cli, you'll have to do that yourself!**

## Scripts

- ```epic.sh```: This is supposed to run weekly, and informs the user (who is assumed to be a self-bot, ie signal-cli is setup as a linked device to that users' account only) of that week's selection of free games on Epic Games Store. It is supposed to just run in the background and give weekly messages with no real followup built.
